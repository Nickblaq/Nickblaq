          About Me
        </h1>

        <p>I'm Ikechukwu. Most folks know me as <strong>I.K</strong> online.
      </p>

      <p>I enjoy creating beautiful things that live on the internet.
        My interest in web dev started back in 2019 when I decided to try out this 2 weeks bootcamp, turns out I had
        obsession and interest in understanding how web technologies work under the hood. 
        Fundermentals like HTML, CSS, JAVASCRIPT, NODEJS, GIT and how they connect and work was my core focus, with educational courses from the tech community, took me time
        to time, dedication, consistency & my passion to be so world class engineer.
        </p>

      <p>After years of study & practice, I found myself privilaged working with a vast spectrum of web technologies what let me gather a significant amount of various experience
         on some amazing projects, consulting and learning more.
      </p>

      <p>Fast forward to 2020, I switched to React because of it's community, educational rsources.
        Within a year I advanced to NEXTJS, which I has been a powerful and developer experience friendly.
         </p>

         <p>Fast forword 2023, I found decided to have a "hard reset" on my approach to building web technologies.
        With React 18, we are forced to rethink how modern web apps can be built.</p>

         <p>
            Most in my field describe themselves as Frontend Enginners but I think we more. <span>My future blog expands on this. Curious? Join waitlist!.</span>
            Current focused on using NEXTJS framework to re-achitect, implement better single codebase with aimed at achieving low cost, hoot boot, low latency, serverside, serverless and more for modern web apps.
