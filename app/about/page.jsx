      <p>As a frontend software engineer, I specialize in creating beautiful &amp; functional web applications. 
        My interest in web development began in 2019 when I enrolled in a two-week bootcamp, which ignited my curiosity in underst&amp;ing how web technologies work.
        </p>

      <p>My core focus was on learning the fundamentals of HTML, CSS, JavaScript, NodeJS, &amp; Git, &amp; how they interconnect to create web applications. 
        Through dedication, consistency, &amp; passion, I studied various educational courses &amp; immersed myself in the tech community to become a world-class engineer.
      </p>

      <p>
      Over the years, I've had the privilege of working with a vast spectrum of web technologies, gaining extensive experience in consulting, learning, &amp; delivering amazing projects.
       In 2020, I switched to React because of its vibrant community &amp; rich educational resources. Within a year, I advanced to NEXTJS, which has become my go-to framework due to its powerful &amp; developer-friendly experience.
         </p>

         <p>
         In 2023, I decided to take a hard reset approach to building web technologies with the release of React 18, which has forced us to rethink how modern web applications can be built. While most people in my field describe themselves as frontend engineers, I see myself as more than that, which is why I plan to share my thoughts on my future blog.

         <p>
         Currently, my focus is on using Vercel in conjunction to other tech stacks to architect &amp; implement a better single codebase that achieves low cost, high availability, low latency, serverside, serverless, &amp; more for modern web applications.
