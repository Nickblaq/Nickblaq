My biggest accomplishment of 2023 so far is taking some time off to focus on myself and it's been awesome so far!.

---

## Here's some goals I achieved so far:

- I grew my knowledge on Web technology and how everything works beyond frameworks, Dom, Web APIs, Core web computing processes, Typescript e.t.c
- Deep understanding of web Api and how they play an important role in web development.
- I always had anxiety working with typescript, overwhemled by doubts I avoided it but decided to give it a try and to be sincere it was tough but I kept on learning and practising. This also led to me upgrading my blog from Javascript to Typescript and for some reasons I don't feel safe writing Javascript again because I was able to catch so much bugs early.
- Practiced using my favourite framework Nextjs to write some pretty cool web apps including this one! React 18 and Nextjs latest architecture was an exciting journey for me, with SSR, Vercel platform building great web apps just got better!.




Incredibly proud of myself and everything I have accomplished so far! â€“ onward to Q2 2023!
